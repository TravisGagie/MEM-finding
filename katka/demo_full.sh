# Full demo: every KATKA experiment in the paper, on the same reads (every 50th simulated read pair, 200,000 per
# region, downloaded from the GitHub release), with the same parameters.
#  1. dependencies, SILVA 138.1 and KATKA (setup_deps.sh, make);
#  2. the reference and every index (silva/build_katka.sh with ALL=1);
#  3. the experiments, in this order (each script says what it measures and where its results go):
#       run_bml.sh, run_bml_ud.sh      MEM threshold L, LCA vs listing, equal credit (digested, undigested)
#       run_freq.sh                    equal, proportional and normalized credit (L = 15, 30)
#       run_counts_all.sh              proportional credit for every L, times of every configuration with
#                                      occurrence counts, and the Pareto set (work/pareto_counts.txt)
#       run_ftab.sh, run_fb.sh, run_tag.sh   lookup tables, forward-backward, tag-array sampling
#       run_kebab.sh, run_trim.sh, run_hyb.sh, run_vfy_acc.sh   the negative results of the appendix
#       run_threads.sh, run_katka.sh   throughput with several threads; the default configuration
# Timings assume an otherwise idle machine.  Needs about 60 GB of disk and 16 GB of RAM, and takes a day or more.
# Resumable: rerun it after an interruption.  STEPS="..." runs only some of the experiment scripts.

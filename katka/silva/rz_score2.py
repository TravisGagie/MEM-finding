# Fast, equivalent re-implementation of "method0" (Cliffy's LCA query) from cliffy-experiments'
# classify_silva_readset.py.  Their version deep-copies a weight table with one entry per clade for
# every read and sends it to worker processes with each read, which takes hours for 1M read pairs on a
# desktop.  This one loads the data with their own classes and applies the same rule with a sparse
# weight table:
#   each match of length L in [left doc, right doc] adds L/(right-left+1) to every document's clade
#   in that range; the read is correct if its true clade is among the clades of maximum weight
#   (so a read with no weight at all counts as correct unless its clade is "uncultured", as in their code); reads whose true clade is
#   missing or ambiguous at a level count as correct, as in their code.
# Output: rz,<mode>,<level>,<accuracy>,correct=..,unclassified=..,wrong=..,reads=..,ambiguous_truth=..,theirs=..
# (accuracy counts unclassified reads as wrong; theirs = accuracy under their rule for unclassified reads;
#  strict = accuracy when a tie for the maximum weight counts as wrong; all three count ties as in their code otherwise).
# --mode lca: a feature {l,r} spreads its length over documents l..r (method0); --mode list: a feature
# {d1..dk} gives length/k to each listed document (the method2 weighting, |M|/|L|); in list mode a feature
# <l,r> (hybrid: answered by its LCA) is weighted as in lca mode.
